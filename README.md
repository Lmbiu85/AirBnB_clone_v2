project Overview:
The project aims to replicate Airbnb's functionality through a command-line interface (CLI).
It starts by establishing a backend console to interact with program data and manage file storage using JSON serialization/deserialization for persistence.

Repository Structure:
The repository contains files organized according to project tasks.
Tasks include ensuring Pep8 compliance, unit testing, defining base classes, implementing file storage, and developing the console interface.

Key Components:
Base Model (BaseModel): Defined in models/base_model.py, it serves as the parent class inherited by all other model classes.
File Storage Management (FileStorage): Implemented in models/engine/file_storage.py, it manages persistent file storage for objects.
Console Interface (console.py): Provides a CLI for users to interact with the program data.
Commands available include:
create: Creates an instance based on a given class.
destroy: Deletes an object based on class and UUID.
show: Displays an object based on class and UUID.
all: Shows all objects or objects of a specific class.
update: Modifies attributes of an object based on class and UUID.
quit: Exits the program.

Usage Examples:
Users can run the console by executing ./console.py within the project directory.
The console prompt (hbnb) indicates that it's ready to receive commands.
Examples demonstrate how to create, show, delete, and update objects using primary syntax (create BaseModel) and alternative syntax (BaseModel.all()).

Alternative Syntax:
Offers advanced syntax for certain commands like all, count, show, destroy, and update for more specific operations.
Examples illustrate how to show all objects, count instances, and update objects using attribute names or dictionaries.

Project Progression:
The project progresses from basic functionalities like creating and updating objects to dynamically implementing more classes (User, Place, City, etc.) and enhancing the console's capabilities.
Version updates (0.0.1 to 1.0) reflect the evolution of the console and file storage system to handle all classes dynamically.i
